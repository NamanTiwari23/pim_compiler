PIM Compiler - A Custom Processor-in-Memory Compiler



ðŸ“Œ Overview
The PIM Compiler is a custom compiler designed for a Processor-in-Memory (PIM) architecture that efficiently executes AI/ML workloads. The compiler translates C++ programs for matrix multiplication into a sequence of custom ISA-compatible instructions, optimizing memory mapping and execution performance.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

Parses C++ programs for matrix multiplication

Converts code into LLVM IR for optimization

Maps memory dynamically for PIM-based execution

Generates custom ISA instructions for efficient computation

Optimized for low-latency and high-throughput processing
